    <span> My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to see her
        running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It is just won't fit!</span>
    <p>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball that had
        rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me
        backwards on to the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy
        that Sasha was smarter than I was!</p>
